Data Studio dashboard to track cumulative SEO goal completions 

We have a client that hired us to complete some SEO work. In our initial onboarding meetings, the Vice President of Sales and his marketing team were struggling to articulate what they wanted out of our efforts. He kept responding really high level to our specific questions asking us to "define what success looks like". We took that to heart and had several goal setting exercises with the client. 

Finally, we agreed that the most important thing that our SEO efforts should do was generate form completions for 2 forms that for offline reasons, were practically the same. Our marketing team usually uses a default report that is setup to draw data from each client's Google Analytics and Search Console accounts for their domain that shows key performance indicators. We made it very clear that we took to heart the reqeust for us to define success so we generated a front-page dashboard that tracked success.

In our front page report we re-articulated the success metric and setup a histogram chart and cumulative line chart that showed both the progress and the total so that the VP of Sales would be able to stay focused on the high level metrics without getting lost in the indicator metrics that he may not understand.

We measured cumulative submissions from the 2 forms completed by users that click on a domain link on an organic search result page.
